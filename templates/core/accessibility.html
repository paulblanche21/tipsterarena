    <h1>Accessibility Statement</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> March 06, 2025</p>
    <p>Tipster Arena is committed to ensuring that our website, services, and applications (collectively, the "Service") are accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. We strive to comply with applicable accessibility standards, such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1, to provide an inclusive experience for everyone.</p>

    <h2>1. Our Commitment to Accessibility</h2>
    <p>We aim to make the Service accessible to users with a wide range of abilities, including those who use assistive technologies such as screen readers, keyboard navigation, and voice recognition software. Our goal is to ensure that all users can access, navigate, and interact with the Service effectively.</p>

    <h2>2. Accessibility Features</h2>
    <p>We have implemented the following features to enhance accessibility:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Keyboard Navigation:</strong> The Service is designed to be fully navigable using a keyboard, allowing users to access all interactive elements without a mouse.</li>
        <li><strong>Screen Reader Support:</strong> We use semantic HTML and ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) landmarks to ensure compatibility with screen readers.</li>
        <li><strong>Text Alternatives:</strong> We provide text alternatives for non-text content, such as images, to ensure that users with visual impairments can access the information.</li>
        <li><strong>Color Contrast:</strong> We aim to maintain sufficient color contrast between text and backgrounds to improve readability for users with visual impairments.</li>
        <li><strong>Resizable Text:</strong> The Service supports browser text resizing without loss of content or functionality.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Ongoing Efforts</h2>
    <p>We are continuously working to improve the accessibility of the Service. Our efforts include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Conducting regular accessibility audits to identify and address barriers.</li>
        <li>Training our development team on accessibility best practices.</li>
        <li>Engaging with users and accessibility experts to gather feedback and make improvements.</li>
        <li>Monitoring updates to accessibility standards, such as WCAG, to ensure ongoing compliance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Known Limitations</h2>
    <p>While we strive to make the Service fully accessible, there may be some limitations. Currently known issues include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Some older user-generated content may not have text alternatives for images.</li>
        <li>Certain interactive elements may require additional ARIA attributes for full screen reader compatibility.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We are actively working to address these issues and welcome your feedback to help us improve.</p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Content</h2>
    <p>The Service may include third-party content, such as embedded videos or advertisements, that we do not control. We cannot guarantee the accessibility of third-party content but encourage third-party providers to meet accessibility standards.</p>
